A work-in-progress repository containing the files for a Summer 2017 Independent Study project centering around malware analysis and an open-source antimalware program coded in C++ for the Win32 environment.

The analysis deals specifically with WannaCry, but the program is intended to be a general 'process checker.'

The most updated version of the report can be found at:

I am currently in the process of rewriting portions of code.
